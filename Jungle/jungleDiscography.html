<p class="author-class" id="author-id">  <link href="/basics/Jungle/style1.css" rel="stylesheet"> Jungle released their single "The Heat" on 21 October 2013 through Chess Club Records. In December 
2013, Jungle were nominated for BBC's Sound of 2014 prize. That year, the group played at South by Southwest in Texas in March 2014. On 16 June 2014, the band played on Jimmy Kimmel 
Live!, and played Glastonbury Festival later that month. Their debut album Jungle was released through XL Recordings on 14 July 2014. To celebrate the release, the band played a special 
launch party on a Peckham rooftop. The show was filmed using drones. During launch week the band played live sessions on BBC Radio 1, 2 and 6 Music. During August 2014, the band played 
Reading and Leeds Festivals. During September 2014, Jungle played live on Le Grand Journal (Canal+), played with Pharrell Williams at London's Roundhouse for the iTunes Festival, and 
played live on Later... with Jools Holland. The album "Jungle" was shortlisted for the 2014 Mercury Prize in September 2014. "Busy Earnin'" was also voted in at Number 67 in the 2014 
Triple J Hottest 100 Countdown in Australia. In early 2015, it was announced that the band would perform at the Boston Calling Music Festival in May 2015. On 26 June 2015, Jungle played
 on the Other Stage at the 2015 Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival. On 9 December 2017, they performed as part of the line up of Trópico, a 3-day-long music festival in Acapulco, Mexico. </p>
